Do you ever wonder what it is that determines which sources of information a person attaches to? I mean, people have strong feelings about this or that issue. Some issues are polarizing, tending to foster "us vs them" mentalities. Certain things are indisputable facts: Chopin was a composer for the piano. The atomic number of titanium is 22. The capital of Russia is Moscow. I would venture to suggest that there is no disagreement on such things.

There are other things that some tend to regard as indisputable fact; however, there is sharp disagreement, even if from a minority. Some people seem to yield to the temptation to cast those who don't toe the line as ignorant or stupid or dishonest, or whatever--the idea being that there can be no intellectually respectable dispute of this fact. If you disagree, you're worthy to be dismissed out of hand.

It's one thing to not agree with another's perspective--if you've thought about your own, and someone else differs, you naturally disagree--but to conclude that the other person is therefore dismissable?

I guess the thing is this. When there are apparently reasonable people who hold a view that departs from the mainstream, I need to ask what they're seeing that others are missing, or what they're attaching significance to that others deem unimportant. It may be that the mainstream thinking is founded on a perspective that, on examination, is superior to alternatives. But what if it's not? What if a different point of view has, in fact, equal validity, so that one's dissenting opinion derives not from a starting point that is merely different and not demonstrably fallacious?
