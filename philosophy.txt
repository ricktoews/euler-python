Anaxagorus suggested that the heavenly bodies were fiery stones.
Anaxagorus believed that nature is a constant mixing and separting.

Empedocles of Acragas believed reality consists of the four elements: fire, air, earth, and water. 

Heraclitus believed reality is the logos. A road up and down is one and the same. Humans live in the world as though asleep and do not take time to carefully observe the world and truly understand it.

Leucippus and Democritus theorized that reality is made up of only atoms and the void. Reality is the coming together, coming apart, and shifting of the smallest particles.
